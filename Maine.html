       <p>The University of Maine is a college in Orono with approximately 11,000 students. As of now my major is business but I believe I am going to change to a major in the field of psychiatry. I have recently realized business bores me and it is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I am looking in the field of psychiatry because I find psychology and the brain fascinating</p>
